/* There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.
On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.
Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

1st round all bulbs will turn on,in 2nd round multiple of 2, 3rd round will have multiple of 3 and so on...AND odd no.of will make bulb turn on and even will turn of 
will make the set{1,4,9} which makes square of bulb.
